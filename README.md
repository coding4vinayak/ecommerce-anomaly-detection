## Overview

The goal of this project is to detect anomalies (like fraudulent transactions) in ecommerce data. XGBoost is used as the main algorithm, with data exploration and visualization done using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

## Features

- Data preprocessing: cleaning, scaling, encoding.
- Anomaly detection using XGBoost.
- Visualization of data and model results using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
- Evaluation metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ecommerce-anomaly-detection.git
   cd ecommerce-anomaly-detection
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Dependencies:
- Python 3.8+
- XGBoost
- Seaborn
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)

Install dependencies with:
```
pip install xgboost seaborn pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Load your dataset into the `data/` folder.
2. Run the script:
   ```
   python anomaly_detection.py
   ```

Alternatively, you can use the Jupyter notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook ecommerce_anomaly_detection.ipynb
   ```

## Data

The dataset consists of transaction information with features like:
- Transaction Amount
- Transaction Country
- Transaction Currency
- Transaction Time
- Card Issuer
- Card Type
- Fraudulent (label)

Use your own data in a similar format.

## Model

The model uses XGBoost, a gradient boosting algorithm.

### Steps:
1. Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding).
2. Model training with XGBoost.
3. Model evaluation using precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Hyperparameters:
You can fine-tune hyperparameters in `anomaly_detection.py` to improve the model's performance.

## Visualization

Seaborn and Matplotlib are used for:
- Correlation heatmaps
- Data distributions
- Feature importance
- Anomaly detection results

Example:
```python
import seaborn as sns
sns.heatmap(df.corr(), annot=True)
plt.show()
```

## Results

After training, the model's performance is evaluated with precision, recall, and F1-score. Sample results:
- Precision: 0.90
- Recall: 0.89
- F1-score: 0.88
